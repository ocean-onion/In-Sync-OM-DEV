# Game Development Plan

## Project Overview

"In Sync" is a joint effort card game where players must work together to play cards in ascending order without communicating. This digital implementation aims to capture the idea of the physical game (The Mind) while adding digital enhancements.

   - Card dealing and distribution
   - Player turns and card validation
   - Win/loss conditions

2. **Player Experience**
   - Private card viewing with wait timers
   - Clear user instructions
   - Input validation
   - Developer tools

3. **Game Logic**
   - Deck preparation and shuffling
   - Card validation (playing lowest card first)
   - Real-time play mechanism

4. **Visual Enhancements**
   - Colour-coded messages
   - Card history display
   - Countdown timer
   - Player statistics (**DEV MOD**)


## Future Plans

For future development, we are considering:

1. **Difficulty Levels**
   - Easy mode with fewer cards
   - Hard mode with more cards

2. **Multiplayer Enhancements**
   - Support for more players (up to 8)
   - Team play options

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Achievement system
