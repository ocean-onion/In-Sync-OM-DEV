# The Error and Fix Explanation

## The Issue
The `prepare_game_deck` function was using a default value of 50 cards per player, which exceeded the available cards in the game after accounting for the 8 confusion cards. This caused inconsistency in card distribution.

<summary>Problematic Code</summary>

```python
# Problematic Code
def prepare_game_deck(num_players, desired_cards_per_player=50):
    total_cards_needed = num_players * desired_cards_per_player
    if total_cards_needed > len(cards):
        cards_per_player = len(cards) // num_players
        total_cards_needed = num_players * cards_per_player
        typingprint(f"Not enough cards for {desired_cards_per_player} each. Using {cards_per_player} cards per player instead.")
    else:
        cards_per_player = desired_cards_per_player
    deck = cards.copy()
    random.shuffle(deck)  # Shuffle the deck
    game_deck = deck[:total_cards_needed]  # Select the cards for the game
    return game_deck, cards_per_player
```
</details>

## The Fix
The fix involves calculating the available cards after removing the confusion cards, and then determining the appropriate number of cards per player.

<details>
<summary>Fixed Code</summary>

```python
# Fixed Code
def prepare_game_deck(num_players, desired_cards_per_player=10):
    # More reasonable default of 10 cards per player
    total_cards_needed = num_players * desired_cards_per_player
    available_cards = len(cards) - 8  # Reserve 8 cards for confusion

    if total_cards_needed > available_cards:
        cards_per_player = available_cards // num_players
        total_cards_needed = num_players * cards_per_player
        typingprint(f"Not enough cards for {desired_cards_per_player} each. Using {cards_per_player} cards per player instead.")
    else:
        cards_per_player = desired_cards_per_player

    deck = cards.copy()
    random.shuffle(deck)  # Shuffle the deck
    game_deck = deck[:total_cards_needed]  # Select the cards for the game
    return game_deck, cards_per_player
```

## What Changed
1. Changed the default cards per player from 50 to a more reasonable 10
2. Reserved 8 cards for confusion effects, ensuring they're not included in the player distribution
3. Properly calculated the available cards before determining how many each player gets
4. Ensured consistent card distribution regardless of player count
