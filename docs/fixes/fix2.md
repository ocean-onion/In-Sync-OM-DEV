# The Error and Fix Explanation

## The Issue
The original `check_lowest_possible` function had inefficient code for collecting all remaining cards from players. It used a loop to extend a list with each player's deck, resulting in unnecessary iterations and code complexity.

<summary>Problematic Code</summary>

```python
def check_lowest_possible(players, played_card):
    remaining_cards = []
    for player in players:
        remaining_cards.extend(player["deck"])
    if not remaining_cards:
        return True
    lowest_remaining = min(remaining_cards)
    return played_card == lowest_remaining
```
</details>

## The Fix
The solution was to replace the manual loop with a more concise list comprehension, making the code more readable and potentially more efficient.

<summary>Fixed Code</summary>

```python
def get_all_remaining_cards(players):
    """
    Returns a list of all cards still in players' decks.
    """
    return [card for player in players for card in player["deck"]]

def check_lowest_possible(players, played_card):
    """
    Checks if the played card is the lowest among all remaining cards.
    """
    remaining_cards = get_all_remaining_cards(players)
    if not remaining_cards:
        return True
    lowest_remaining = min(remaining_cards)
    return played_card == lowest_remaining
```
</details>

## What Changed
1. Created a new helper function `get_all_remaining_cards` to extract the card collection logic
2. Replaced the loop and extend operation with a list comprehension
3. Added docstrings to explain function purpose
4. Made the code more modular by separating concerns
5. Improved readability and maintainability of the code
