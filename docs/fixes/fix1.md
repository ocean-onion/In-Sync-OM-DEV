# The Error and Fix Explanation

## The Issue
In early drafts of the game, when a player made an incorrect move, the code tried to display which player should have played the lowest card. However, it used the variable `correct_player` without properly defining it first, causing a runtime error.

<summary>Problematic Code</summary>

```python
def game_loop(players):
    while True:
        # Game code...

        if check_lowest_possible(players, chosen_card):
            play_card(player, chosen_card)
            typingprint(f"{player['name']} played {chosen_card} successfully!")
        else:
            remaining_cards = []
            for p in players:
                remaining_cards.extend(p["deck"])
            lowest_card = min(remaining_cards)

            # Error: Using correct_player without defining it
            typingprint(f"Wrong move! {player['name']} played an incorrect card. Game over.")
            typingprint(f"The correct card to play was {lowest_card}, and it should have been played by {correct_player}.")
            return
```

## The Fix
The solution is to properly identify which player has the lowest card before trying to use the `correct_player` variable.

```python
def game_loop(players):
    while True:
        # Game code...

        if check_lowest_possible(players, chosen_card):
            play_card(player, chosen_card)
            typingprint(f"{player['name']} played {chosen_card} successfully!")
        else:
            remaining_cards = []
            for p in players:
                remaining_cards.extend(p["deck"])
            lowest_card = min(remaining_cards)

            # Fix: Define correct_player before using it
            correct_player = "Unknown"
            for p in players:
                if lowest_card in p["deck"]:
                    correct_player = p["name"]
                    break

            typingprint(f"Wrong move! {player['name']} played an incorrect card. Game over.")
            typingprint(f"The correct card to play was {lowest_card}, and it should have been played by {correct_player}.")
            return
```

## What Changed
1. Added code to identify and store the name of the player who has the lowest card
2. Used a loop to check each player's deck for the lowest card
3. Set the `correct_player` variable before trying to use it
4. Added a `break` statement to stop searching once the correct player is found
5. Ensured the error message correctly shows who should have played the lowest card
