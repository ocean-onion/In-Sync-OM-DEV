# The Error and Fix Explanation

## The Issue
The game lacked a dedicated function to find which player had a specific card. This made it difficult to identify and communicate which player should have played the lowest card when an error occurred.

<summary>Problematic Code</summary>

```python
def game_loop(players):
    # ...code...
    
    if not check_lowest_possible(players, chosen_card):
        remaining_cards = get_all_remaining_cards(players)
        lowest_card = min(remaining_cards)
        correct_player = "Unknown"
        
        # Inefficient inline code to find the player with the lowest card
        for p in players:
            if lowest_card in p["deck"]:
                correct_player = p["name"]
                break
                
        typingprint(f"Wrong move! {player['name']} played an incorrect card. Game over.")
        typingprint(f"The correct card to play was {lowest_card}, and it should have been played by {correct_player}.")
        return
```
</details>

## The Fix
The solution was to create a dedicated function `find_correct_player` that encapsulates the logic for finding which player has a specific card, making the code more modular and reusable.

```python
def find_correct_player(players, card):
    """
    Finds which player has a specific card.
    
    Args:
        players (list): List of player dictionaries
        card (int): The card to search for
        
    Returns:
        str: The name of the player who has the card
    """
    for player in players:
        if card in player["deck"]:
            return player["name"]
    return "Unknown"  # Fallback if not found

def game_loop(players):
    # ...code...
    
    if not check_lowest_possible(players, chosen_card):
        remaining_cards = get_all_remaining_cards(players)
        lowest_card = min(remaining_cards)
        correct_player = find_correct_player(players, lowest_card)
        
        typingprint(f"Wrong move! {player['name']} played an incorrect card. Game over.")
        typingprint(f"The correct card to play was {lowest_card}, and it should have been played by {correct_player}.")
        return
```
</details>

## What Changed
1. Created a new function `find_correct_player` to encapsulate player lookup logic
2. Added proper documentation with docstrings explaining the function's purpose
3. Made the code more modular and easier to maintain
4. Improved code reusability as the function can be used in multiple places
5. Added a fallback return value of "Unknown" when a card isn't found in any player's deck
