# In Sync Game - Project Plan

## 1. Project Pitch

### Game Idea
"In Sync" is a cooperative card game where players work together to play their cards in ascending orderâ€”without communicating. Each player is dealt a hand of cards with numbers ranging from 1 to 70. Before the game begins, a random selection of cards is removed from the deck, making it impossible to know exactly which numbers are in play. Players must rely on intuition and timing to play their cards in the correct order without discussing their hands or giving any hints.

### Rules
1. Players are dealt cards from a deck numbered 1-70 (with some cards randomly removed)
2. Players must play their cards in ascending order
3. No communication allowed between players about their cards
4. If a card is played out of order, the game ends
5. If all cards are played in correct order, players win

### Objective
Successfully play all cards in ascending numerical order without verbal communication.

### Core Features
- Create and shuffle a deck of cards (1-70) with random cards removed
- Deal cards to 2-4 players
- Allow players to play cards in real-time (any player can play at any time)
- Check if cards are played in the correct order
- Track played cards history
- Determine win/loss conditions
- Privacy mechanisms for viewing cards with countdown
- colour-coded messages and styling
- Developer commands for testing and debugging

### Stretch Goals
- Team mode
- Add difficulty levels with more cards
- Implement a system where teams have lives mistakes are allowed and lives are subtracted at the end
- Add a scoring system
- Create visual cards
- Blind mode (no confirmation of card values)
- Speed mode (time limit for decisions)

## 3. Design

### Main Functions

1. **styled_start_game()**: Initialize the game, get player count, create deck
2. **create_players(num_players)**: Create player objects with names and empty hands
3. **prepare_game_deck(num_players)**: Create and shuffle deck, determine cards per player
4. **deal_cards(deck, players, cards_per_player)**: Distribute cards to players
5. **game_loop(players)**: Main game loop handling real-time play and win/loss conditions
6. **check_lowest_possible(players, card)**: Check if played card is the lowest in all hands
7. **play_card(player, card)**: Remove card from player's hand and add to played cards
8. **find_correct_player(players, card)**: Find which player has a specific card
9. **get_all_remaining_cards(players)**: Get all cards remaining in players' hands
10. **show_cards(player)**: Display a player's cards with privacy controls
11. **play_turn()**: Processes a player's turn, validates the move, and updates or ends the game

## 4. Development

The game has been implemented in Python with the following structure:

1. **Main Game Versions**:
   - Plain text version (plaingame.py)
   - Styled version with colours (styledgame.py)

2. **Utility Functions**:
   - Text styling and formatting
   - Timing controls (countdown, typing effects)
   - Screen clearing
   - Developer commands
   
3. **Game Evolution**:
   - Started with basic turn-based system
   - Changed to real-time play where any player can make a move
   - Added privacy features with countdowns
   - Enhanced with card history tracking
   - Implemented developer commands for testing
   - Rebranded Game to own-original naming

4. **Current Features**:
   - Real-time gameplay
   - Privacy mechanisms when viewing cards
   - Card history display
   - colour-coded messages
   - Developer mode for testing
   - Extended card deck with random removal

## 5. Testing Plan

Testing follows this approach:
1. Unit test each function individually (**Finished**)
2. Integration test combinations of functions (**Finished**)
3. Full game testing with different player counts (**Finished**)
4. User testing with actual players (**Finished**)

## 6. Tools Required

- Python 3.11
- Built-in Python libraries:
  - random (for shuffling)
  - time (for typing effect and countdown)
  - sys (for display functions)
  - os (for clearing screen)
